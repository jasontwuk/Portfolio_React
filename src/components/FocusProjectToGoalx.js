          <h5>Purpose and Goal</h5>
          <p>
            The purpose of ToGoalx was to apply my knowledge of Next.js, TypeScript, Firebase and other front-end technologies, such as React.js, to build a practical, real-world web application. My goal in building this project was not only to create a functional app that simplifies goal management but also to gain hands-on experience with these technologies.

          <h5>Challenges and My Approach</h5>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Real-time Updates and Interactivity: The need for real-time updates across the dashboard meant ensuring efficient backend communication without lag. I leveraged modern frontend frameworks and asynchronous processing to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tracking Goal Progress: Accurately tracking progress across multiple goals requires a robust system. To ensure clarity, I built a progress tracker that tracks completion rates of different goals in real-time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creating an Intuitive User Interface: Designing an interface that balances simplicity with powerful features was a challenge. To solve this, I focused on minimalistic design principles, ensuring that users could easily navigate between goal-setting, tracking, and reviewing progress without feeling lost or overwhelmed.
